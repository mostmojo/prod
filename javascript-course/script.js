function foo() {
    var age = 65;
    console.log(age); // 65 as foo function has it's own execution context object
}

console.log(age); // 23 because var age on line 25 is stored in global execution context object

// since var age (the first one) is defined in global execution context, we can have another var age variable within a function (execution context within a function). We can have the same var age and JS won't throw an error because they're in a completely different context!

first();

function first() {
    var b = 'Hi!';
    second();

    function second() {

var a = 'Hello!';
