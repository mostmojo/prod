// since var age (the first one) is defined in global execution context, we can have another var age variable within a function (execution context within a function). We can have the same var age and JS won't throw an error because they're in a completely different context!

/*

* function third() will ONLY print out Hello! John as it only has access to var a (global variable) + d.
* The other two vars b + c are in a local scope which it doesn't have access too.
* The second function can call the third function - third() because it has access to the global first() function.
* third() can access var a + d because they're both in global scope.
