function foo() {

}

console.log(age); // 23 because var age on line 25 is stored in global execution context object

// since var age (the first one) is defined in global execution context, we can have another var age variable within a function (execution context within a function). We can have the same var age and JS won't throw an error because they're in a completely different context!

// First scoping example

var a = "Hello!";

    function second() {
        var c = "Hey!";

// Returns: Hello!Hi!Hello - thanks to the scoping chain. The second function is written inside the first function, written inside the global function.

// Example to show the differece between execution stack and scope chain

var a = 'Hello!';
first();

function first() {
    var b = 'Hi!';

/*

* function third() will ONLY print out Hello! John as it only has access to var a (global variable) + d.
* The other two vars b + c are in a local scope which it doesn't have access too.
* The second function can call the third function - third() because it has access to the global first() function.
* third() can access var a + d because they're both in global scope.
