# ES6

* Use ES6 and then polyfill or transpile to ES5 for production
* Variable declarations - let and const
* Blocks and IIFEs
* Strings
* Arrow Functions
* Destructuring
* Arrays
* Promises and Native Modules
* Spread Operator
* Classes and subclasses
* Rest and default parameters

-----

* Variables in ES5 `var` are **function** scoped, whereas in ES6 `const` & `let` are **block** scoped.
* We can only use a variable once it's been declared and defined.
